## How to build a Quarto website

**Notes**

Creating a website with QUARTO

We have a repo

Clone the repo to R studio

Create project commands (<https://quarto.org/docs/websites/>)

On the terminal, write the command for creating quarto website

This gives us the structure of a Quarto website, all the minimum pieces it requires

Talk about the structureÂ  of the files, what did just happen!

Each Qrmd is one page on out website

In the quarto YML - brings all together (orchestra director)

-   Add a new QurtoRmd

Hosting in github pages
